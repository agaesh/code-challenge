# Code Challenge – Problem 1: Summations (Completed)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates three different approaches to solving the summation problem (sum of numbers from 1 to _n_):

1. **For Loop** – Iterative summation
2. **Array.reduce** – Using JavaScript’s built-in reducer
3. **Recursion** – Recursive function calls

The functions are exposed via an **Express.js server** with endpoints to test and view results
---

## 🚀 Features
- `sum_to_n_a(n)` → Summation using a `for` loop
- `sum_to_n_b(n)` → Summation using `Array.reduce`
- `sum_to_n_c(n)` → Summation using recursion
- Express server with:
  - `/problem1` → Returns JSON results of all three summation methods

Got it — let’s regenerate the documentation for **Problem 5** in a clean, professional style that matches your repo’s format. Here’s a polished section you can drop straight into your README:

# Code Challenge – Problem 5: CRUD User Server (Completed)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API** for managing users, built with **Express.js** and **SQLite**. It provides endpoints to add, retrieve, update, and delete user records, with support for filtering and audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Database Connection**
  - `db.js` initializes a SQLite database using `better-sqlite3`.
  - `users` table includes:  
    - `id` (primary key)  
    - `name`, `email`, `age`, `phone`  
    - `created_at` (auto‑set on insert)  
    - `updated_at` (auto‑updated on modification)

- **CRUD Endpoints**
  - `POST /problem5/users` → Create a new user  
  - `GET /problem5/users` → Retrieve all users (supports filters: `name`, `email`, `age`, `phone`)  
  - `GET /problem5/users/:id` → Retrieve a single user by ID (supports `?fields=` query to select specific columns)  
  - `PUT /problem5/users/:id` → Update an existing user by ID (refreshes `updated_at`)  
  - `DELETE /problem5/users/:id` → Delete a user by ID  

---

# 🚀 Running the Server

## 1. Start the Application
 
Start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:

```
Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 2. Problem 4 – Summation
Open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000/problem4
```

You’ll see JSON output showing the results of the three summation methods:

```json
{
  "forLoop": 15,
  "reducer": 15,
  "recursion": 15
}
```

---

## 3. Problem 5 – CRUD Users

### View All Users
Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/problem5/users
```

This returns all users in the database.  
You can also filter with query parameters:

```
http://localhost:3000/problem5/users?name=agaesh
```

---

### Create a User (POST)
Use **curl** or Postman to send a POST request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/problem5/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Agaesh Kumar","email":"agaesh@example.com","age":25,"phone":"123456"}'
```

---

### Update a User (PUT)
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/problem5/users/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Agaesh K.","email":"agaesh.k@example.com","age":26,"phone":"987654321"}'
```

---

### Delete a User (DELETE)
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/problem5/users/1
```

---

## 4. Notes
- **Browser** is good for GET routes (`/problem4`, `/problem5/users`, `/problem5/users/:id`).  
- **POST/PUT/DELETE** require tools like curl, Postman, or any REST client.  
- `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are automatically managed by the database and included in responses.

---

## 1. Running TestCase
 
Start the Server with:

```bash
npm test
```

Writting the npm test in terminal will run the integration test

# Code Challenge – Problem 6: Live Leaderboard (Partial)

## 📌 Overview
Problem6 implements a **real-time scoreboard** that displays the top 10 user scores.  
The system updates automatically whenever a user completes an action (e.g., submitting a quiz).  

### Features Implemented
1. **Scoreboard** – shows the top 10 users by score.  
2. **Live updates** – leaderboard is broadcast via WebSocket to all connected clients.  
3. **User actions** – completing an action increases the user’s score.  
4. **API integration** – backend updates the database and dispatches leaderboard updates via broadcast.  
5. **Security/authorization** – **not yet implemented** (malicious score inflation prevention still pending).  

---

## 🚀 Endpoints
- `GET /problem6/leaderboard`  
  Returns the current top 10 users and broadcasts the leaderboard to WebSocket clients.

- `POST /problem6/submit-quiz`  
  Accepts quiz answers, calculates points, updates the user’s score, and broadcasts the updated leaderboard.

---

## 📂 Files
- **Client.js**  
  WebSocket client that connects to `ws://localhost:3000` and listens for real-time leaderboard updates.

- **src/problem/QuizAndAns.js**  
  Contains quiz questions, options, and correct answers used to calculate score increments.

- **src/problem/Architecture.js**  
  Defines Problem6 routes:  
  - `/problem6/leaderboard`  
  - `/problem6/submit-quiz`

---

## 📦 Packages Used
- **ws** – WebSocket server and client for real-time communication.  
- **better-sqlite3** – lightweight SQLite database for storing and updating user scores.  

---

## 🛠️ Running Problem6
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Run the WebSocket client (optional, for testing):
   ```bash
   npm run live
   ```
   *(configured in `package.json` to run Server and `node client.js` Silmutaneously)*

Note: Problem 6 uses the same user table used by problem 5. Users should be added first and then for problem 6, updating score through submit-quiz will trigger broadcast to send to all clients. to test it npm run live must be used.
---

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Implement **authorization and validation** to prevent malicious users from inflating scores.  
- Add **audit logging** for score updates.  
- Extend Client.js to display leaderboard visually in the browser.
